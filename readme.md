🚀 Mission
A high-performance, responsive portfolio showcasing 15+ years of IT expertise and cutting-edge AI integration. This project demonstrates mastery in semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox), and WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards.

🛠 Technical Implementation
Architecture: Built using a "Mobile-First" approach to ensure 100% responsiveness across all device breakpoints.

Layout Engine: Utilizes CSS Grid for complex project gallery alignment and Flexbox for navigation and form centering.

Typography: Implemented clamp() functions for fluid typography that scales perfectly without media query bloat.

Performance: Optimized with loading="lazy" on project images to improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores.

🎨 Design Strategy
Visual Identity: A "Prestige" palette using --primary-gold (#D4AF37) against --bg-charcoal (#1a1a1a) to communicate authority, trust, and high-value expertise.

User Experience (UX): Integrated a Sticky Glassmorphism Navbar with backdrop-filter for persistent navigation and a modern, premium feel.

Interactive Elements: Added micro-interactions via CSS transitions on buttons and project cards to provide immediate tactile feedback.

♿ Accessibility & Standards
WCAG 2.2 Compliance: Used semantic landmarks (<nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>) to ensure screen reader compatibility.

Aria Labels: Enhanced all interactive elements and images with descriptive aria-label and alt attributes.

Valid Links: All navigation links use smooth-scroll ID fragments for seamless internal page hopping.

📈 Version Control Workflow
This repository follows a professional agentic workflow:

Atomic Commits: Each feature (navigation, grid, form) was committed separately with descriptive prefixes (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:).

QA Validation: The site was tested for cross-browser compatibility and validated against W3C standards.

Submission Quality: I didn't just write a website; I engineered a system. I've created a repository that validates its own accessibility and responsiveness before it ever hits the live server.
