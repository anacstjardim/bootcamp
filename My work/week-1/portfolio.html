                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a full-stack web developer and AI engineer currently completing a Level 4 Full Stack Web Developer qualification. Most of my time is spent building AI-powered solutions for educational technology, with 15+ years of experience in IT education and a strong foundation in both web development and machine learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>AI & Machine Learning Focus:</strong> As the founder of SWCyber Nexus CIC, I spend the majority of my time developing AI systems for EdTech. I've built proof-of-concept AI course creation engines that reduce development time from 80 hours to 2 hours using OpenAI GPT-4 and Whisper API. I work extensively with large language models, fine-tuning custom models for educational content, implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and building AI-powered personal tutoring systems. My AI work includes natural language processing, video transcription, automated content generation, and semantic search using vector databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> I build the platforms that host these AI systems using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python. I integrate AI APIs into production applications, design scalable architectures for AI workloads, and ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.2 compliance) across all solutions. My experience includes API development, database design, microservices architecture, and deploying AI models to production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Education & Industry Experience:</strong> With 15+ years teaching IT and Computer Science across multiple schools and colleges, I have deep understanding of educational needs, learning challenges, and how technology can solve real problems in education. This experience informs my AI development work, ensuring solutions are practical and address genuine user needs. I've also prepared grant applications for AI innovation funding and built products that create both business value and social impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I Bring:</strong> I combine deep AI/ML expertise with full-stack development skills, strong communication, and a track record of delivering innovative solutions. I'm looking for opportunities to work on AI-powered projects, contribute to cutting-edge technology initiatives, and grow as part of a collaborative team.
